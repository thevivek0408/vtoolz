## 🧱 CSP Tightening Roadmap

The project currently uses an allowlist CSP with `'unsafe-inline'` / `'unsafe-eval'` for compatibility across many tools.
This roadmap hardens CSP in safe, staged steps without breaking tools:

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
- Keep functionality stable, but standardize CSP policy text across pages.
- Remove shortcut conflicts and avoid adding new inline handlers/styles.
- Track pages still using inline `style="..."`, `on*=` attributes, or eval-dependent libs.

### Phase 2 (Migration)
- Move inline styles into CSS classes and component utilities.
- Replace inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, etc.) with `addEventListener` in JS modules.
- Reduce third-party CDN dependencies where possible (self-host critical assets).

### Phase 3 (Hardening)
- Remove `'unsafe-eval'` first (after validating vendor bundles).
- Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` after handler migration.
- Introduce nonce/hash-based policy for any remaining unavoidable inline script.

### Phase 4 (Strict CSP)
- Enforce strict CSP for `script-src` and tighter `connect-src` / `font-src` / `img-src` scopes.
- Add CSP validation in CI to prevent regressions.
